-- 1. Audit RLS Policies (Are tables protected?)
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    policyname, 
    permissive, 
    roles, 
    cmd, 
    qual, 
    with_check 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

-- 2. Audit Foreign Keys (Are relationships enforced?)
SELECT
    tc.table_schema, 
    tc.table_name, 
    kcu.column_name, 
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY' AND tc.table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY tc.table_name;

-- 3. Audit Indexes (Performance check - simplified)
SELECT
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- 4. Check for tables with NO RLS enabled (Critical)
SELECT relname as table_name, relrowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
  AND c.relkind = 'r'
  AND c.relrowsecurity = false;
